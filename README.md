A defensive Raspberry

Nowadays, with the Internet Of Things, more and more computer tools exist and more and more people have access to devices connected to the network. 
As a result, the number of cyber attacks is increasing, hence the importance of securing oneâ€™s network. 
This is where the idea of Raspberry Onion came from to provide an easy-to-use defensive security solution that includes an intrusion detection system, 
malicious traffic detection and the ability to capture and analyze network traffic, all on a Raspberry Pi 4 to ensure the security of a home network.

Our solution includes a dozen tools for network security on a Raspberry Pi 4 which are : 

-For network security and event alerts:
Snort, Barnyard2, PulledPork, Aanval, Maltrail

-For full packet capture and analysis:
Wireshark, TCPdump, TrimPCAP, Chaosreader

-For IPS logs:
Fail2ban

-For cyber operations.
